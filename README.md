StyleMe is an AI-driven web application built using Python (with Streamlit and OpenCV) that provides personalized clothing recommendations based on the userâ€™s body type. The aim is to help users find outfits that suit their physical shape, improving their shopping experience and confidence in style.

The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze a user's uploaded image or webcam feed and determine their body shape (such as rectangle, hourglass, pear, apple, or inverted triangle). Based on this analysis, the site recommends a curated set of clothing styles and tips tailored to the user's body type.
